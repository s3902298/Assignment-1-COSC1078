                        <p>Hi! My name's Chris, and I'm studying my first year of IT in RMIT. I've got a Polish background, though I barely speak Polish and am instead learning French. In high school I enjoyed Systems Engineering and Mathematical Methods classes, and have been using my programming skills throughout.</p>

                        <p>While I like to think of myself as being open to suggestions, and try to consider other viewpoints as much as I can, I must admit that I always liked things going my way - or at least correctly.
                        <p>I doubt I'd be able to work effectively in a team of people who don't care for details and present half-working models as finished products, or who cannot accept a more efficient method of doing something or even look from different perspectives.
                        <p>Rather, I must be interacting with others who strive for efficiency over practicality and are open to learning better ways of doing something, but would also patiently allow others like me to learn things for themselves. The biggest obstacle I find in forming a team, however, is my lack of social skill; until I get to know someone I will avoid casually talking with them. Ultimately, I believe working with a diverse group of people, with different approaches to things, will benefit myself and the group most.</p>

                        <h2>Why I'm Here</h2>
                        <p>From a young age I was interested in computers and video games, always wanting to make a game of my own. With the help of my dad, I learned how to use electronics fluently and slowly began experimenting with our old laptop.
                        <p>Like most students in my primary school, my first experience with real programming began with a simple visual language. Noticing I had a knack for coding, I moved on to writing simple

                        and much later becoming known in
                        <a target="_blank" href="http://lowres.inutilis.com">a small game-making community</a>.
                        Of course, I was playing many video games during this time, and not only did building

                        even inspired me to learn C#, opening the door to real-world languages. At the moment I'm writing Bash and Python terminal scripts, and have the experience to solve most problems with
                        <a target="_blank" href="https://stackoverflow.com/">StackOverflow</a>.
                        <p>I ultimately decided to come to RMIT because it specializes in what I want to do in the future . Although I have worked on some group projects in the past, I still need to learn how to effectively work in real, professional teams. I'm looking forward to writing programs with people as passionate as I.</p>

                        <h2>My Ideal Job</h2>
                        <p>My "ideal job" would be to work for a group of my friends on programming games. I'm hoping I'll end up making enough to support myself without having to work elsewhere.
                        <p>Of course, I feel far from ready to take on such a responsibility. While I am able to solve problems and write code, being comfortable with troubleshooting issues, my only real experience with working as a team is working on

                        frequently running into errors in communication. I have yet to learn how to motivate myself to keep working on really large projects where I may encounter a road block, too, but I think a sense of commitment will come with working with others.
                        <p>All in all, I feel I will be much more prepared after having completed my RMIT course, where I will be practicing all of those things.</p>

                        <h2>Intro to My Idea</h2>
                        <p>While playing video games, I usually crank the volume up and play music, or sometimes I put a YouTube video on another monitor. Occasionally I may even put on my VR headset and become fully immersed in the game world, but while this increases the enjoyment of using a computer, I also get jumpy when I see someone walk into my room from the corner of my eye - in some cases I may not even notice people until they stand right next to me, and start panic to pause the game and everything else.
                        <p>Thus, I introduce: <i>Automatic Game Pauser</i> (AKA <i>Auto Volume Decreaser</i>, AKA <i>Auto Alt-Tabber</i>, <i><s>AKA Auto Porn Hider</s></i>)! Using an Arduino or similar to detect a door opening, a gesture or keybind, the script may automagically decrease the volume of the system, pause media playback, or do anything else one may need to take notice of the real world for once in their lives!</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="contentGroup">
                        <h2>Detailed Description</h2>
                        <p>Though this idea is simple in principle, I believe it will require quite a bit of work to realize due to its configurable nature - users must be able to specify which applications to minimize, whether to pause playback, how much to decrease the volume, or possibly even what inputs to automatically simulate, not to mention what to restore and when (if the door closes, or if a keybind is necessary). This would need to be effectively visualized and easily modified - modifiable action elements in a listbox would suffice - and actions performed on programs may need to be recorded by the software as typing names may be tedious or impossible for non-technical users.
                        <p>Additionally, triggering of the system must allow a large variety of options for the sake of accessibility; users who do not have an Arduino and some kind of sensor for detecting the opening of a door must be able to quickly activate the system though other means, perhaps with a mouse gesture or keybind. Scripts for microcontrollers may need to be supplied with the script to properly send messages to the host computer, through serial communication or wirelessly, and all managed and configured from within the software GUI and all bound actions.
                        <p>Creating a system that allows users to manage actions and . Implementation and interfacing with various programs will also be a challenge, however can definitely be accomplished with libraries such as <code>pyautogui</code> for Python.</p>
