                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>Hi! My name's Chris, and I'm studying my first year of IT in RMIT. I've got a Polish background, though I barely speak Polish and am instead learning French. In high school I enjoyed Systems Engineering and Mathematical Methods classes, and have been using my programming skills throughout.</p>
                    <p style="font-size: 14px;">I use arch btw</p>
                    <p style="font-size: 8px;">Not really, I'm just a Mint normie...</p>

                    <h2>Why I'm Here</h2>
                    <p>From a young age I was interested in computers and video games, always wanting to make a game of my own. With the help of my dad, I learned how to use electronics fluently and slowly began experimenting with our old laptop.
                    <p>Like most students in my primary school, my first experience with real programming began with a simple visual language. Noticing I had a knack for coding, I moved on to writing simple

                    and much later becoming known in
                    <a target="_blank" href="http://lowres.inutilis.com/">a small game-making community</a>.
                    Of course, I was playing many video games during this time, and not only did building

                    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.spaceengineersgame.com/">another game</a>
                    even inspired me to learn C#, opening the door to real-world languages. At present I'm interested in writing Bash and Python terminal scripts, and if need be can use
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://stackoverflow.com/">StackOverflow</a>
                    to solve most problems.
                    <p>I ultimately decided to come to RMIT because it specializes in computing. Although I have worked on some group projects in the past, I believe I need to learn how to effectively work in real, professional teams developing software. I'm looking forward to writing programs with people as passionate as I am.</p>

                    <h2>My Ideal Job</h2>
                    <p>While I like to think of myself as being open to suggestions, I must admit that I always liked things going my way - or at least correctly.
                    <p>I doubt I'd be able to work effectively in a team of people who don't care for details and present half-working models, or who cannot accept a more efficient method of doing something.
                    <p>Rather, I must be interacting with others like me, who strive for efficiency over practicality and are open to learning better ways of doing something. The biggest obstacle I find in forming a team, however, is my lack of social skill; until I get to know someone I will avoid casually talking with them. Ultimately, I believe working with a diverse group of people, with different approaches to things, will benefit myself and the group most.</p>
